    <h2>How to Write Strong Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, longer than sentences, but shorter than sections, chapters, or entire works. Because they connect the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a “bigger” idea, paragraph structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and comprehension. 

      Students have a lot of questions when it comes to writing a paragraph: How many sentences should you use? How do you transition within a paragraph? When do you end a paragraph? Etc. Below we explain everything you need to know about paragraph structure to write like an expert, including several paragraph examples. </p>

    <h2>How to plan a paragraph</h2>
    <p>Before you begin writing a paragraph, look at how the paragraph fits into the writing as a whole. As mentioned above, different types of writing use different types of paragraphs, so make sure the paragraph type you’re planning matches the context. 

      Ideally, you’ll already have an outline for whatever you’re writing, which will tell you what the paragraph is about and what to include. If not, your first step is to decide on the paragraph topic and which facts to include as support and development. 
      
      Keep in mind what comes before and after the paragraph so you can plan the right topic for the flow of your writing. It’s jarring for the reader when the author jumps wildly from one topic to the next, so try to keep all related paragraphs together and in a logical sequence. If that’s not possible, plan your topic sentence as a segue, perhaps using a transition word. 
      
      It also helps to sketch out the parts of your paragraph: topic sentence, development and support, and conclusion. The more you prepare these parts now, the easier it will be to put them into words later. </p>
